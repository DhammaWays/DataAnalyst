You are given a ten piece box of chocolate truffles. You know based on the label
that six of the pieces have an orange cream filling and four of the pieces have
a coconut filling. If you were to eat four pieces in a row, what is the
probability that the first two pieces you eat have an orange cream filling and
the last two have a coconut filling?

Answer:
First Method:
Let us denote "O" for picking orange cream filling chocolate, and "C" for coconut
filling chocolate. So our problem becomes:

P(Picking "OOCC" in order)
    = P(First as "O") * P(Second as "O") * P(Third as "C") * P(Fourth as "C")
    
P(First as "O") = 6/10 (since there are 6 organge ones out of total 10)
P(Second as "O") = 5/9 (since there are now only 5 orange ones out of remaining total 9)
P(Third as "C") = 4/8 (since we have 4 coconut ones out of remaining total 8)
P(Fourth as "C") = 3/7 (since teher are now only 3 coconut ones out of remaining total 7)

Therefore,
P(Picking "OOCC" in order) = 6/10 * 5/9 * 4/8 * 3/7 = 1/14

Second Method:
Total possible ways to pick 4 chocolates of 10 = 10C4 = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2) = 210
Ways to pick 2 orange chocolates out of 6 = 6C2 = (6*5)/2 = 15
Ways to pick 2 coconut chocolates out of 4 = 4C2 = (4*3)/2 = 6

Since we want to pick 2 orange first,
P(Picking two oranges first) = 15/210 = 1/14

Follow-up question: If you were given an identical box of chocolates and again
eat four pieces in a row, what is the probability that exactly two contain
coconut filling?

Answer:

First Method:
Let us denote "O" for picking orange cream filling chocolate, and "C" for coconut
filling chocolate.

There are 6 ways (4C2) of picking exactly two coconut filling choclates out of 4.
These are: OOCC, OCCO, CCOO, COCO, OCOC, COOC

So, our probability becomes,

P(Exactly two "CC") 
    = P("OOCC") + P("OCCO") + P("CCOO") + P("COCO") + P("OCOC") + P("COOC")
    = 6/10*5/9*4/8*3/7 + 6/10*4/9*3/8*5/7 + 4/10*3/9*6/8*5/7 + 4/10*6/9*3/8*5/7
      + 6/10*4/9*5/8*3/7 + 4/10*6/9*5/8*3/7
    = 1/14 + 1/14 + 1/14 + 1/14 + 1/14 + 1/14
    = 6/14 = 3/7
    
Second Method:

Total possible ways to pick 4 chocolates of 10 = 10C4 = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2) = 210
Ways to pick 2 orange chocolates out of 6 = 6C2 = (6*5)/2 = 15
Ways to pick 2 coconut chocolates out of 4 = 4C2 = (4*3)/2 = 6

Since we want to exactly 2 coconut chocolates out of 4, it means we need to also
pick 2 orange choclates.

P(Picking exactly two coconut chocolates out of 4)
    = P(Picking two chocolates AND Picking two orange chocolates)
    = (6 * 15)/ 210
    = 3/7
